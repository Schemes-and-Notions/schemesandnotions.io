## Whats going on here?!

I wired the contacts for the button on each of my garage door openers to a [relay board](http://amzn.com/B0057OC6D8), connected that to an [ESP8266](http://amzn.com/B081CSJV2V), and programmed it with ESPHome using the [generic output switch function](https://esphome.io/components/switch/output.html).

Once I get the full tutorial on how to do this, I'll provide wiring diagrams and example configuration files for ESPHome.
